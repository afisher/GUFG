Project: Ground Up Fighting Game

A fighting game from scratch, built with SDL in C++.

This repo should contain the complete game, including source code and data files.

Currently the project is coordinated through a semi-private googledoc collection. If you're interested in helping, email eshink@gmail.com to be shared on the documents
